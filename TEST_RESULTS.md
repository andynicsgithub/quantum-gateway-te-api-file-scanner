# Phase 1 Test Results

**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Version:** v7.0  
**Platform:** Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) with Python 3.13.5

## Test Environment Setup ✅

- ✅ Python 3.13.5 installed
- ✅ Virtual environment created (`venv/`)
- ✅ Dependencies installed (requests, urllib3)
- ✅ Test directory structure created
- ✅ Configuration file created (`config.ini`)

## Tests Performed

### 1. Help Command ✅
```bash
python te_api.py --help
```
**Result:** SUCCESS - Help displayed correctly with all options including new `--watch` flag

### 2. Configuration Loading ✅
**Test:** Load configuration from `config.ini` and validate

**Results:**
```
Configuration Summary:
  Input directory:       test_input
  Reports directory:     test_reports
  Benign directory:      test_benign
  Quarantine directory:  test_quarantine
  Error directory:       test_error
  Appliance IP:          192.168.1.100
  Concurrency:           2
  Seconds to wait:       15
  Max retries:           120
  Watch mode:            Disabled
```

**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS - Configuration loaded and validated correctly

### 3. PathHandler Tests ✅

#### Path Normalization
- Linux path `/home/user/test` → `✅ Normalized correctly`
- Windows path `C:\Users\test` → `✅ Normalized correctly`

#### UNC Path Detection
- `\\server\share` → `✅ Correctly identified as UNC (True)`
- `/mnt/share` → `✅ Correctly identified as NOT UNC (False)`

#### SMB Path Detection
- `/mnt/share` → `✅ Correctly identified as SMB (True)`
- `/home/user` → `✅ Correctly identified as NOT SMB (False)`

#### Platform Detection
- Is Windows → `✅ False (running on Linux)`
- Supports long paths → `✅ True (Linux has no limit)`

**Result:** ✅ All PathHandler tests passed

### 4. Module Imports ✅
- ✅ `config_manager.py` imports successfully
- ✅ `path_handler.py` imports successfully (after fixing docstring escape sequences)
- ✅ `te_api.py` loads without errors
- ✅ `te_file_handler.py` loads without errors

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Escape Sequence Warnings ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Docstrings with backslashes (`\\server\share`) caused SyntaxWarning

**Solution:** Added `r` prefix to docstrings containing backslashes:
```python
r"""
- Windows UNC paths (\\server\share)
"""
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed in commit (pending)

## Test File Structure Created

```
test_input/
├── test1.txt
├── subdir1/
│   └── test2.txt
└── subdir2/
    └── test3.txt
```

**Purpose:** Ready for actual TE appliance testing when available

## What Was NOT Tested

The following features cannot be tested without a real TE appliance:

- ❌ Actual file scanning via TE API
- ❌ File upload to appliance
- ❌ Verdict retrieval (Benign/Malicious/Error)
- ❌ File movement based on verdicts
- ❌ Report downloading for malicious files
- ❌ Multi-file concurrent processing
- ❌ Archive file handling

These will need to be tested on a machine with access to a TE appliance.

## Platform-Specific Tests Needed

### Windows Testing Required
- [ ] Test on Windows 10/11 or Server 2016+
- [ ] Test with UNC paths (`\\server\share`)
- [ ] Test cross-drive moves (C:\ to D:\)
- [ ] Test file locking retry logic
- [ ] Test with Windows long paths (>260 chars)

### Linux SMB Testing Required
- [ ] Test with mounted SMB share
- [ ] Test network latency retry logic
- [ ] Test checksum verification on network transfers

### Real TE Appliance Testing Required
- [ ] Connect to actual TE appliance
- [ ] Upload and scan real files
- [ ] Verify verdicts and file movements
- [ ] Test with mix of benign and malicious samples
- [ ] Test archive extraction
- [ ] Verify report downloads

## Verification Checklist

### Code Quality ✅
- [x] No syntax errors
- [x] All imports resolve correctly
- [x] Configuration system works
- [x] Path handling works
- [x] Help text displays correctly
- [x] Docstring warnings fixed

### Functionality (Limited Testing)
- [x] Configuration loading from file
- [x] Configuration validation
- [x] Path normalization (cross-platform)
- [x] UNC path detection
- [x] SMB path detection
- [x] Platform detection
- [ ] File scanning (requires TE appliance)
- [ ] File movement (requires TE appliance)
- [ ] Report generation (requires TE appliance)

### Documentation ✅
- [x] README.md updated with v7.0 info
- [x] Installation instructions for Linux/Windows
- [x] Configuration examples
- [x] Platform-specific notes
- [x] Troubleshooting guide

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the docstring fix**
   ```bash
   git add path_handler.py
   git commit -m "Fix escape sequence warnings in PathHandler docstrings"
   git push
   ```

2. **Test on Windows** (when available)
   - Install Python on Windows machine
   - Clone repository
   - Create venv and install dependencies
   - Test with local paths and UNC paths
   - Verify all platform-specific features

3. **Test with Real TE Appliance** (when available)
   - Configure `config.ini` with real appliance IP
   - Place test files in input directory
   - Run scanner: `python te_api.py`
   - Verify files are scanned and moved correctly
   - Check reports are generated

4. **Proceed to Phase 2** (after validation)
   - Implement file watching with `watchdog`
   - Add `--watch` mode functionality
   - Test continuous monitoring

## Summary

**Phase 1 Status:** ✅ **PASSED** (All testable features working)

The cross-platform refactoring has been successfully implemented and all components that can be tested without a TE appliance are working correctly:

- Configuration management ✅
- Path handling (Windows UNC + Linux SMB) ✅
- Platform detection ✅
- Module structure ✅
- Documentation ✅

The code is ready for:
1. Windows platform testing
2. Real TE appliance integration testing
3. Phase 2 implementation (watch mode)
